Do you need more help? Visit my server here: **https://discord.gg/kQ8CE5GRNg** ü™ê

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 and up - https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Useful to always have
Keep [this](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) saved somewhere, as this is the docs to discord.py@rewrite.
All you need to know about the library is defined inside here, even code that I don't use in this example is here.

## How to setup
1. Make a bot [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and grab the token
![Image_Example1](https://i.hizliresim.com/DhvHwY.png)

2. Rename the TOKEN in **oreskis_bot.py**, then fill in the required spots, such as token, prefix and game

3. To install what you need, do **pip install -r requirements.txt**<br>
(If that doesn't work, do **python -m pip install -r requirements.txt**)<br>
`NOTE: Use pip install with Administrator/sudo`

4. Start the bot by having the cmd/terminal inside the bot folder and type **python oreskis_bot.py**

5. You're done, enjoy your bot!

## FAQ
Q: I don't see my bot on my server!<br>
A: Invite it by using this URL: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=bot<br>
Remember to replace **CLIENT_ID** with your bot client ID

Q: There aren't that many commands here...<br>
A: Yes, I will only provide a few commands to get you started, maybe adding more later.

# Optional tools
### Flake8
Flake8 is a tool that helps you keep your code clean. Most coding softwares will have a plugin that supports this Python module so it can be integrated with your IDE. To install it, simply do `pip install flake8`. If you're using python 3.7, install by doing `pip install -e git+https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8#egg=flake8`

### PM2
PM2 is an alternative script provided by NodeJS, which will reboot your bot whenever it crashes and keep it up with a nice status. You can install it by doing `npm install -g pm2` and you should be done.
```
# Start the bot
pm2 start pm2.json

# Tips on common commands
pm2 <command> [name]
  start discord_bot.py    Run the bot again if it's offline
  list                    Get a full list of all available services
  stop discord_bot.py     Stop the bot
  reboot discord_bot.py   Reboot the bot
```

### Docker
Docker is an alternative to run the bot 24/7 and always reboot again whenever it crashed. You can find the install manual [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/). You don't *have* to get it, but if you're used to having Docker, it's available at least.
```
# Build and run the Dockerfile
docker-compose up -d --build

# Tips on common commands
docker-compose <command>
  ps      Check if bot is online or not (list)
  down    Shut down the bot
  reboot  Reboot the bot without shutting it down or rebuilding
  logs    Check the logs made by the bot.
```

### Repl.it
You can run this on [Repl.it](https://repl.it/)! Make sure to setup **config.json** in the way stated above.
